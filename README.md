Abstract - This report explores the transformative potential of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in robotic vision especially, reinforcement learning, focusing on efficient environment representation. VAE reduces dimensionality while preserving data structure, enabling robust navigation of complex state spaces. By encoding data into a lower-dimensional latent space, VAE enhances robotic decision-making and adaptability. The latent space's probabilistic nature ensures continuity, smoothness, and adherence to a known distribution, facilitating meaningful transitions between states and data generation. A correlation between environmental complexity and VAE training dynamics is uncovered, revealing that simpler scenarios yield rapid convergence to low loss values, while more intricate environments involve slower convergence and higher final loss values, necessitating adaptive learning strategies. The interplay between the encoder and decoder components proves pivotal. The encoder maps data to a lower-dimensional latent space, and the decoder reconstructs data while preserving relationships. This synergy empowers manifold learning, bolstering reinforcement learning, control, and decision-making in robotics. This work underscores VAE's transformative potential in addressing the challenges posed by complex robotic environments, opening avenues for future research and innovative solutions in autonomous robotics.
